Police called in the Salinas Fire Department to use a fire hose as a tactic to subdue the \"irrational\" boy. Three officers deployed Tasers and non-lethal rounds. The fire hose, Tasers, and non-lethal rounds were all ineffective in disarming the boy.When the boy walked inside a house, officers decided to follow him because they were concerned that the teen may make people inside hostages. Once inside the house, the boy turned toward the officers; he was still wielding his knife. One officer shot the boy six times with an AR-15 rifle, while a second officer shot the boy twice with a handgun. At least one of the gunshots killed him.",

At some point, deputies spotted Kalonji waving a rifle. One deputy fired a handgun, another shot a rifle and one more fired at least one beanbag round. After the officers fired, Kalonji retreated into his second-floor apartment and locked himself inside one of the rooms. Kraus said the deputies heard at least one shot come from inside the unit. It's uncertain who shot and/or killed Kalonji.",
